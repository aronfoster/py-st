# Project Architecture

This is a python 3 application.

- Code is in `src/py_st`
- Data structures are in `src/py_st/_generated` but accessed through `src/py_st/models.py`
- Tests are in `tests`
- Use `.venv/bin/python` to run python in your context

## Coding Standards

- You must limit all changes to 79 characters or less per line
- Use industry standards for python
